I am currently splitting my time between **quantitative research** and **scientific community management**.

I work as a Quantitative Researcher at the [Royal Society of Arts](https://www.thersa.org/), where I work on interventions that aim to enable people, places and the planet to flourish in harmony. As part of my role, I work on enhancing our digital infrastructure to enable open, reproducible, and collaborative research, for example by maintaining our [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/theRSAorg).

I also work as a Scientific Community Manager at Imperial College London, specifically the [UNIVERSE-HPC project](https://www.universe-hpc.ac.uk/). The UNIVERSE-HPC project aims to define a training curriculum framework, spanning from undergraduate to continuing professional development level, for Research Software Engineers (RSEs) specializing in high performance computing (HPC).

I previously completed a PhD Student at the the Psychology of Language department of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen. In my PhD research, I studied how processes of language production and language comprehension affect memory, especially when combined into conversation. I investigated these topics using behavioural measures and eye-tracking methods, both in the lab and online, under the supervision of [Dr Laurel Brehm](https://linguistics.ucsb.edu/people/laurel-brehm) and [Professor Antje Meyer](https://www.mpi.nl/people/meyer-antje).
