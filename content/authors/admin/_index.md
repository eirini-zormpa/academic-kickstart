I am currently a PhD Student at the the Psychology of Language department of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen. My research interests lie in the intersection of language and memory. In my PhD research, I study how processes of language production and language comprehension affect memory, especially when combined into conversation. I investigate these topics using behavioural measures and eye-tracking methods, both in the lab and online, under the supervision of [Dr Laurel Brehm](https://www.mpi.nl/people/brehm-laurel-ellen) and [Professor Antje Meyer](https://www.mpi.nl/people/meyer-antje).

During my PhD, I also became passionate about open science and reproducibility. I advocate for the adoption of open science practices within the Nijmegen campus as a co-founder and organiser of the [Open Science Community Nijmegen](https://openscience-nijmegen.nl/). I am also enthusiastic about open source software and an active member and organiser of the R-Ladies Nijmegen chapter.

Before coming to Nijmegen, I completed an MSc in Language Sciences at the University of Reading, where I worked on a project exploring the influence of bilingual experience and implicit learning. I earned my BA in English Language and Literature from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, where I worked on a project on the production and comprehension of narratives by bilingual children.
